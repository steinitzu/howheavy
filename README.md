# Spotifetch

Spotifetch is a Spotify playlist generator.  
It uses the [Spotify web API](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/) to generate song recommendations based on artists in the user's library along with tuneable acoustic attributes.  
The intention is to generate playlists with a certain "mood" or "feel" without being restricted to any particular set of genres.   

This app is live at [spotifetch.com](http://www.spotifetch.com).
